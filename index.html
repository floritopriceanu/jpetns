        <h2>What is Educate Together</h2>
        <p>Educate Together is the patron body of the growing network of schools in Ireland that are run according to the Educate Together Charter. It is an independent NGO that runs schools that guarantee equality of access and esteem to children "irrespective of their social, cultural or religious background", are learner centred in their approach to education and are run as participatory democracies, with respectful partnership between parents, pupils and teachers.
          For over 35 years Educate Together has been working to establish inspirational schools for children in Ireland. Schools that teach to the highest standards of education through an ethos that guarantees every child equality of esteem, regardless of their social, cultural or religious background. These principles of equality have been the foundation for every Educate Together school that has opened since the Dalkey School Project was established in 1978.</p>
          <h2 id="heading-mv">Mission & Values</h2>
          <p>Educate Together will be an agent for change in the Irish State Education system seeking to ensure that parents have the choice of an education based on the inclusive intercultural values of respect for difference and justice and equality for all. In Educate Together schools, every child will learn in an inclusive, democratic, co-educational setting that is committed to enabling and supporting each child to achieve their full potential while at the same time preparing them to become caring and active members of a culturally diverse society</p>
